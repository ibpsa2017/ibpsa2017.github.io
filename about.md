About This Effort
===


My name is Theo Armour. I heart simulation, 3D and free open source software.

I enjoy programming a lot. I try to write code that's easy for beginners to understand.

The code I write tends to be demos involved with [STEAM]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEAM_fields ) topics.

I happily live in San Francisco in a seventy year old, moderately disabled body that has lived in many places and had tons of adventures.

I work closely with [ladybug.tools]( http://www.ladybug,tools) and maintain the [Ladybug Web]( http://www.ladybug.tools/ladybug-web/tt6-ladybug-web-r1-all-in-one.html#README.md ) repository.
