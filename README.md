The International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA) is a non-profit international society of building performance simulation researchers, developers and practitioners, dedicated to improving the built environment.


This is an unofficial site created by and for Building Simulation 2017 conference attendees.

## Simulating Building Simulation

We love simulating things. We find simulating stimulating.

These days nearly anything can be simulated. So **let's simulate the Building Simulation 2017**. ;-)

On the left are two menu items that simulate conference sponsors and all the conference sessions.

These fast and fun little items have only one simulation issue: they link to real events at a real conference.

Both scripts were written this week, so they may have issues. The source code is free and open source and on [GitHub]( https://githib.com "nice peeps" ). Click the 'Edit this file' button on the top right of any of these pages. to start fixing or hacking.

If you notice or see anything at the conference that could use ~~stimulating~~ simulating then [just holler]( https://github.com/ibpsa2017/ibpsa2017.github.io/issues "a good place to holler" )!

## Unofficial IBPSA 2017 Conference Agenda Catalog Simulation

Building Simulation 2017 is a huge operation. There are hundreds of sessions. We count over 260 submitted papers.

With so much going on it feels like Disneyland, there's fun and eye-candy and good stuff all over the place. So what sessions should you attend? How should you plan your day?

The official catalog is here:

## [Building Simulation Conference Agenda]( https://www.conftool.pro/bs2017/sessions.php )

The catalog is extensive and has a lot of features. You can print each page and the app allows you to limit the number of colums for nicer printing. There does not seem to be a method to print the entire catalog. You must print each session individually. Some pages - not all - allow you to enlarge the text. Every session with a PDF allows you to download th PDF but, sadly, not view it online. Of course, speakers and their organizations are listed though there are no links to the Authors pages. The time and place for every session is listed though there seems to be no way to see what is going on at any specific day and time

With all of this is going on it is a good thing to do as much planning as possible prior to the events. You want to be attending not selecting.

So the more planning aids the better. Just like a building sim, we want to look at the same data in different ways. The architect, civil engineer and HVAC installer all have different needs and perspectives on a structure. Ditto conferences.

One helpful thing might be viewing the entire catalog in a single page. 

So we built a listing of all the sessions listed in the Conference Agenda wrapped up in a single page.

## First Forays: Hacking Conferences Nicely

The EPW Parser is my first foray onto displaying EnergyPlus weather (EPW) data in 3D. The challenge: Can you show 365 x 24 x 8 items of weather data all at once in a readable manner?

Let us just say that this little effort has aspects that are interesting.

But the main thing is that we are up and running. And there is a **much bigger challenge at hand**. This new challenge is to see: can create new material during the conference itself? Can we stop mucking around with last year's PDFs. Instead, can live in the moment and create and design or identify some new patterns based on what we are seeing and hearing in the sessions?

Have you ever participated in a [hackathon]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon ). There is a liveness - and a lack of sleep - contrasts markedly with the usual demeanor at traditional style conferences.

There's nothing particularly right or wrong about either type of meet-up. But I'm thinking it might be fun to bring in some hacking thoughts - nice ones - into the process.

Things I want to do include:

* Looking at some complex visualization or analysis and seeing if it's possible to create some of the effect with eazy peazy, beginner level code
* Respond to any 'I bet you can't do this' challenges
* Explore ways of communicating / simulating with participants

There are two important side aspects to this thinking

* Helping beginners get started wit code they can understand and use to perform helpful tasks
* Helping full-stack developers tackle even more advanced work because they know the lower end is being taken of 

Of course, everything will be free and open source and available on GitHub with links from this site.

Bye for now...
