We love simulating things. We find simulating stimulating.

These days nearly anything can be simulated. So lets simulate the Building Simulation 2017. ;-)

On the left are two menu items that simulate conference sponsors and all he conference sessions.

Theses fast and fun little items have only one issue: they link to the real events at the real conference.

The EPW Parser is my first foray onto displaying EnergyPlus weather (EPW) data in 3D. The challenge: Can you show 365 x 24 x 8 items of weather data all at once in a readable manner?

Let us just say that this little effort has aspects that are interesting.

But the main thing is that we are up and running. And there is a much bigger challenge at hand. This new challenge is to see: can create new material during the conference itself? Can we stop mucking around with last year's PDFs. Instead, can live in the moment and create and design or identify some new patterns based on what we are seeing and hearing in the sessions?

Have you ever participated in a [hackathon]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon ). There is a liveness - and a lack of sleep - contrasts markedly with the usual demeanor at traditional style conferences.

There's nothing particularly right or wrong about either type of meet-up. But I'm thinking it might be fun to bring in some hacking thoughts - nice ones - into the process.

Things I want to do include

* Looking at some complex visualization or analysis and seeing if it's possible to create some of the effect with eazy peazy, beginner level code
* Respond to any "I bet you can't do this' challenges
* Explore ways of communicating / simulating with participants

There are two important side aspects to this thinking

* Helping beginners get started wit code they can understand and use to perform helpful tasks
* Helping full-stack devs tackle even more advanced work because they know the lower end is being taken of 

Of course, everything will be free and open source and available on GitHub with links from this site.

Bye for now...
