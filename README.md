The International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA) is a non-profit international society of building performance simulation researchers, developers and practitioners, dedicated to improving the built environment.


This is an unofficial site created by and for Building Simulation 2017 conference attendees.

## Simulating Building Simulation

We love simulating things. We find simulating stimulating.

These days nearly anything can be simulated. So **let's simulate the Building Simulation 2017**. ;-)

On the left are two menu items that simulate conference sponsors and all the conference sessions.

These fast and fun little items have only one simulation issue: they link to real events at a real conference.

Both scripts were written this week, so they may have issues. The source code is free and open source and on [GitHub]( https://githib.com "nice peeps" ). Click the 'Edit this file' button on the top right of any of these pages. to start fixing or hacking.

If you notice or see anything at the conference that could use ~~stimulating~~ simulating then [just holler]( https://github.com/ibpsa2017/ibpsa2017.github.io/issues "a good place to holler" )!

## First Forays: Hacking Conferences Nicely

The EPW Parser is my first foray onto displaying EnergyPlus weather (EPW) data in 3D. The challenge: Can you show 365 x 24 x 8 items of weather data all at once in a readable manner?

Let us just say that this little effort has aspects that are interesting.

But the main thing is that we are up and running. And there is a **much bigger challenge at hand**. This new challenge is to see: can create new material during the conference itself? Can we stop mucking around with last year's PDFs. Instead, can live in the moment and create and design or identify some new patterns based on what we are seeing and hearing in the sessions?

Have you ever participated in a [hackathon]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon ). There is a liveness - and a lack of sleep - contrasts markedly with the usual demeanor at traditional style conferences.

There's nothing particularly right or wrong about either type of meet-up. But I'm thinking it might be fun to bring in some hacking thoughts - nice ones - into the process.

Things I want to do include:

* Looking at some complex visualization or analysis and seeing if it's possible to create some of the effect with eazy peazy, beginner level code
* Respond to any 'I bet you can't do this' challenges
* Explore ways of communicating / simulating with participants

There are two important side aspects to this thinking

* Helping beginners get started wit code they can understand and use to perform helpful tasks
* Helping full-stack developers tackle even more advanced work because they know the lower end is being taken of 

Of course, everything will be free and open source and available on GitHub with links from this site.

Bye for now...
