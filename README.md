## Introduction to Open Web Tools Miniworkshop 

2017-08-08: Earlier versions of what you saw today are here: http://www.ladybug.tools/ladybug-web/tt6-ladybug-web-r1-all-in-one.html#README.md

There will be a new repo with new material from the demos here plus more in a short time.

Check back here for the link.

Thank you all for your support. Yes, I do silly things. But if in the process we all learn new ways of thinking then maybe it's not so silly after all.
