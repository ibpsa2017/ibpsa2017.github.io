## Full Scree: [EPW Parser]( file:///D:/Dropbox/Public/git-repos/ibpsa2017.github.io/epw-parser/epw-parser-r2.html )

## Concept

The challenge: Can you show 365 x 24 x 8 items of weather data all at once in a readable manner?

## About
From: https://energyplus.net/weather/simulation

> Weather data for more than 2100 locations are now available in EnergyPlus weather format — 1042 locations in the USA, 71 locations in Canada, and more than 1000 locations in 100 other countries throughout the world. The weather data are arranged by World Meteorological Organization region and Country.

> Users of energy simulation programs have a wide variety of weather data from which to choose – from locally recorded weather data to preselected 'typical' years –, often a bewildering range of options. Many locations are available on this site – but users may have special needs for different locations. This page lists sites that may provide those other user locations. Before tapping the resources below, users should check if an existing EnergyPlus Weather Format (EPW) file is within 20-30 miles (30-50 km) and within a few hundred feet (100 m) of elevation.

## Issues

* Would it make sense to upload all the EPW files to GitHub so that can be accessed online?
